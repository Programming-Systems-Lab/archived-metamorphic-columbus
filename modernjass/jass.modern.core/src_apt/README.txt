The files in this project contain the source code for the annotation
processing apt mirror API, com.sun.mirror.*, introduced in J2SE
5.0. By compiling these source files and creating a jar file holding
the resulting class files, the jar file can be put on javac's
classpath instead of tools.jar to compile annotation processors.
